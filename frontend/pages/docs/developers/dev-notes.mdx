# Developer Notes

A quick list of things that developers think of when coding.

- Never use `console.log` on the server, always use `logger` from utils.
- Always run `npm run build` to check your types are valid across the project.
- Don't run `npm run build` and `npm run dev` simultaneously.
- VS: Code TypeScript messing around? Try `Ctrl + Shift + P` -> `Typescript: Restart TS Server`
- Never respond with status codes, instead `throw BadReq` and let the error handler sort it.

## Remote Debug (Visual Studio Code)

Remote debug has been configured to enable developers to start a debug session that is connected to a running Bailo
container. To use Remote Debug in VS Code navigate to 'Run and Debug', select 'Docker: Attach to Node' and press the
green triangle icon. Developers can use debugging tools as they would if the application was running in VS Code. For
example, inserting breakpoints, stepping through code and inspecting the variable explorer.

Remote Debug has been configured for the local development environment via the 'docker-compose-dev' and is running on
port '9229'.
