# Duplicate Version

## Why This Error Occurred

The model that you have tried to update already has the same model version.

## How to fix This

When updating a model ensure that you edit the 'Model Version' field to a different version, then submit on the
Submission tab.

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
