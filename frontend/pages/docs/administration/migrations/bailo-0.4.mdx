## Bailo Migration to v0.4

Whilst Bailo v0.4 does not introduce any database or major code changes, it does feature a reorganisation of the
project. Instead of the existing format where we had a single 'app', we now split it into two images:

- frontend
- backend

The frontend section handles rendering the UI. When run in production, it is entirely statically built, simply sending
raw HTML files to the user. The backend handles all API requests and provides the interactivity of the service.

The code originally in `server` is now stored in the `backend` folder.

### Turbo

To handle multiple repositories, we now use the `turborepo` build system. It provides us with high performance and
reproducible builds, only compiling what has changed since the last compilation. The monorepo is comprised of 'apps':

- frontend
- backend

And libraries:

- lib/shared
- lib/p-mongo-queue
- lib/node

These are each individual npm packages, with their own `package.json` files, scripts and more. A script can be run in
individual repositories by using `--workspace`, or in all by omitting it:

```bash
# From the root directory

# Will run only in the 'backend' app
npm run script -- exampleSetAllSchemas
# Will run in all packages, both apps and libraries
npm run style
```

Most commands, like `npm install` will default to running in all workspaces. This allows you to run `npm install` a
single time in the root directory and it will install all dependencies across all applications.

Workspaces is a standard NPM function, read more about it on the
[Workspaces page](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces). In addition, the `turbopack` docs can be found
[here](https://turbo.build/repo/docs).

### ESM

The 'backend' application now runs entirely as ESM. This requires a modern NodeJS version, at least v14+. Some changes
are also made to how tests are written. Specifically, to mock dependencies there is now a need to mock the dependency
_first_ using `unstable_mockModule` and then dynamically import it:

```javascript
const version = await import('../../services/version.js')
jest.unstable_mockModule('../../services/version.js', () => {
  return {
    ...version,
    findVersionByName: jest.fn(),
  }
})

const { findVersionByName } = await import('../../services/version.js')
```

There is an intention to possibly switch to an alternative test runner to alleviate this issue (e.g. Vitest). More can
be read on how Jest works with ESM [here](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules). No other changes should be seen
within the application, beyond imports requiring a `.js` ending. We have `esModuleInterop` enabled, which should mean we
remain compatible with both old and new packages.

#### What is ESM?

ESM, or ECMEAScript Modules, is the latest standard for packaging / modularising JS code, as opposed to CJS, or Common
JavaScript. ESM has a number of benefits that include nicer import/export syntax, better code reusability, and also the
ability to import modules asynchronously.

For more information about ESM, we recommend visiting:

- [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html)
- [webpack.js.org](https://webpack.js.org/guides/ecma-script-modules/)

### Helm

To support running two containers, minor changes have been made to our `helm` charts. These changes add a new 'frontend'
container, which requires no environment variables / setup. All traffic should route to the frontend container EXCEPT:

- `/api`, which should be sent to the backend container.
- `/v2`, which should be sent to the Docker registry.

The backend environment variables / mount locations remain unchanged. The frontend serves static files, so requires
minimal setup.

The helm folder has changed, it is now stored in `infrastructure/helm`, this change was made to allow other deploy
methods.

### Config

We've taken the time to reduce the number of duplicate configuration options we have, and try to standardise the
existing values. If you are using a service such as helm, you may not need to make any changes.

The configuration is now also labelled to help advise on what each setting changes. Some major changes:

- `minio` connection options are now stored under `minio.connection` and passed directly to the `minio` library.
- `minio.uploadBucket` is now called `minio.buckets.uploads`
- `minio.registryBucket` is now called `minio.buckets.registry`
- `minio.createBuckets` is now called `minio.automaticallyCreateBuckets`

- `smtp` connection options are now stored under `smtp.connection` and passed directly to the `node-mailer` library.

- `s2i.builderImage` has been moved to `ui.seldonVersions` and is now an array of names and images. These are to allow
  users to select the correct Seldon version to build from

- `openshift.appPublicRoute` is removed in favour of `app.protocol`, `app.host` and `app.port`
- `openshift` is now under `build.openshift`.
- `uiConfig` is now `ui`

- `listen` has been split into `app.port` for the frontend and `api.port` for the backend

export default ({ children }) => <DocsWrapper>{children}</DocsWrapper>
