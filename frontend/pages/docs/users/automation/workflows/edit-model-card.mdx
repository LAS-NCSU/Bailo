## Edit Model Card

This updates an existing model card. This endpoint cannot be used to update artefacts attached to the model card (code,
docker files, etc). It will reset any existing approvals on the model card.

### Update Latest Version

```python
# If you have an existing model, the easiest way to grab this is from the URL
# when you visit the model.  It's also available under the '.uuid' field on
# any model object and returned when uploading a new model.
model_uuid = "fasttext-language-identification-p8xwvz"

# Fetch information about the model
model = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/api/v1/model/uuid/{model_uuid}").json()

# This request gets more information than we need, filter down to just the latest versions metadata.
version = model["latestVersion"]
model_card = version["metadata"]

# Update the metadata as required
model_card["highLevelDetails"]["modelInASentence"] = "New Description"

response = requests.put(
    f"{BASE_URL}/api/v1/version/{version['_id']}",
    json=model_card,
)

print(response.json())
```

### Update Specific Version

```python
# If you have an existing model, the easiest way to grab this is from the URL
# when you visit the model.  It's also available under the '.uuid' field on
# any model object and returned when uploading a new model.
model_uuid = "fasttext-language-identification-p8xwvz"

# This should be version "name" for a model card.  Do not use the internal
# identifier, which will be a MongoID (e.g. 647cbd2b29ba31090e9423c3)
version = "v1.0"

# Fetch information about the version
version = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/api/v1/model/{model_uuid}/version/{version}").json()

# This request gets more information than we need, filter down to just the latest versions metadata.
model_card = version["metadata"]

# Update the metadata as required
model_card["highLevelDetails"]["modelInASentence"] = "New aa 2a"

response = requests.put(
    f"{BASE_URL}/api/v1/version/{version['_id']}",
    json=model_card,
)

print(response.json())
```
