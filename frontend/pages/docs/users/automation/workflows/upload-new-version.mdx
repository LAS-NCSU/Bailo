## Upload New Version

Upload a new version to an existing model card. This allows you to upload a new machine learning image version. Most
settings can change between model uploads (e.g. upload type and binaries). Currently, the schema must be identical to
the initial upload schema, but this is not intended to be a limitation in the final product.

### Using Latest Version as Base

The below examples all assume you have your `model_card` already within your Python script. Most automated tools are
likely to only wish to upload specific fields (e.g. a CI platform may want to update the test scores for a model). In
any of the below instances, the following script can be used to fetch the latest model card for a given model.

```python
def latest_model_card(model_uuid: str):
    # Fetch information about the model
    model = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/api/v1/model/uuid/{model_uuid}").json()
    return model["latestVersion"]["metadata"]
```

### With Docker Tar

```python
# If you have an existing model, the easiest way to grab this is from the URL
# when you visit the model.  It's also available under the '.uuid' field on
# any model object and returned when uploading a new model.
model_uuid = "fasttext-language-identification-p8xwvz"

# A new version for this model.  If this version already exists the request
# will fail.
new_version = "v1.2"

# Change the request type to upload code and binaries.
model_card["buildOptions"]["uploadType"] = "Prebuilt Docker image"

# Make sure to update the schema to the desired version.
model_card["schemaRef"] = "/Minimal/General/v10"

model_card["highLevelDetails"]["modelCardVersion"] = new_version

# Usage of 'files' to set the request to a multipart form upload.
response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/api/v1/model",
    params={"mode": "newVersion", "modelUuid": model_uuid},
    files={
        "docker": open("docker.tar", "rb"),
        "metadata": (None, json.dumps(model_card), 'application/json'),
    },
)

print(response.json())
```

### With Code / Binary

```python
# If you have an existing model, the easiest way to grab this is from the URL
# when you visit the model.  It's also available under the '.uuid' field on
# any model object and returned when uploading a new model.
model_uuid = "fasttext-language-identification-p8xwvz"

# A new version for this model.  If this version already exists the request
# will fail.
new_version = "v1.2"

# Change the request type to upload code and binaries.
model_card["buildOptions"]["uploadType"] = "Code and binaries"
model_card["buildOptions"]["seldonVersion"] = "seldonio/seldon-core-s2i-python37:1.10.0"

# Make sure to update the schema to the desired version.
model_card["schemaRef"] = "/Minimal/General/v10"

model_card["highLevelDetails"]["modelCardVersion"] = new_version

# Usage of 'files' to set the request to a multipart form upload.
response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/api/v1/model",
    params={"mode": "newVersion", "modelUuid": model_uuid},
    files={
        "code": open("code.zip", "rb"),
        "binary": open("binary.zip", "rb"),
        "metadata": (None, json.dumps(model_card), 'application/json'),
    },
)

print(response.json())
```

### Model Card Only

```python
# If you have an existing model, the easiest way to grab this is from the URL
# when you visit the model.  It's also available under the '.uuid' field on
# any model object and returned when uploading a new model.
model_uuid = "fasttext-language-identification-p8xwvz"

# A new version for this model.  If this version already exists the request
# will fail.
new_version = "v1.2"

# Change the request type to upload code and binaries.
model_card["buildOptions"]["uploadType"] = "Model card only"

# Make sure to update the schema to the desired version.
model_card["schemaRef"] = "/Minimal/General/v10"

model_card["highLevelDetails"]["modelCardVersion"] = new_version

# Usage of 'files' to set the request to a multipart form upload.
response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/api/v1/model",
    params={"mode": "newVersion", "modelUuid": model_uuid},
    files={
        "metadata": (None, json.dumps(model_card), 'application/json')
    },
)

print(response.json())
```
