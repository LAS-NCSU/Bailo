# Key Workflows

Here we document some key workflows for interacting with Bailo, and how to implement them in various languages. This is
to supplement the API Documentation pages, which describe each API call. Code examples will be given in Python, but
should be able to be converted into other languages.

## General Notes

- Any endpoint that may take in files will have a request encoded as a `multipart/form-data` stream.
- Any endpoint that is a 'get' request will take in parameters as query strings.
- Any endpoint that is a 'put' or 'post' request will take in data as 'application/json'.

All scripts rely on the following setup:

```python
import requests
import json

BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080"

# The model card for your instance of Bailo may have extra fields.  These are the key fields that every
# instance of Bailo will support.
model_card = {
  "highLevelDetails": {
    "tags": ["facebook", "fasttext", "NLP", "language", "language_identification", "multilingual"],
    "name": "FastText Language Identification",
    "modelInASentence": "Performs language identification of words",
    "modelOverview": "Performs language identification of words in utf-8, capable of recognizing up to 176 languages.",
    "modelCardVersion": "v1.0"
  },
  "contacts": {
    "uploader": [{ "kind": "user", "id": "user" }],
    "reviewer": [{ "kind": "user", "id": "user" }],
    "manager": [{ "kind": "user", "id": "user" }]
  },
  "buildOptions": {
    "uploadType": "Model card only"
  }
}
```

We also assume there are files called 'docker.tar', 'code.zip' and 'binary.zip' in the current directory when working
with calls that require the uploading of one of these files.

### List of Guides:

- [Upload a new model to Bailo (Docker, Code / Binaries, Model Card Only)](./workflows/create-a-model)
- [Edit an existing model card](./workflows/edit-model-card)
- [Upload a new version for an existing model](./workflows/upload-new-version)

Do none of these guides match your requirements? [Request a new one here](https://github.com/gchq/Bailo/issues) or write
your own.
