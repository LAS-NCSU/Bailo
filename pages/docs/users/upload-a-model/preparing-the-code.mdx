# Preparing the Code

In addition to the model card, Bailo expects every upload to come with a `code` and `binary` file. These files contain
the supporting code and binary data respectively.

## Binary

The `binary` file contains your models vectors or data. This is a model specific format and has no requirements beyond
being uploaded as a compressed `.zip` file.

## Code

The `code` file should be a compressed `.zip` file with the following file structure:

```txt
code.zip/
├─ Model.py
├─ requirements.txt
└─ basemodel/
   ├─ basemodel.py
   └─ __init__.py
```

- `model.py`: discussed under the [Model Wrapper](./model-wrapper) section.
- `requirements.txt`: is a standard dependency file, explained in detail by
  [PyPa](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/).
- `basemodel.py` & `__init__.py`: is an abstract class to help you implement the requirement functions. The template is
  copied below:

```python
# __init__.py
from .basemodel import BaseModel

# basemodel.py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class BaseModel(ABC):
    """
    The BaseModel class provides an abstract template for model contributors.
    Models must provide a predict method but do not have to provide metrics or metadata
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """
        The model should be loaded here in the Model sub-class generated
        from the BaseModel abstract class

        Example:
            self.model = load_model("model")
        """
        super().__init__()

    def predict(self, input, features_names):
        """
        Provides a model prediction for a given input and set of feature names
        :param input: Prediction input containing a data component
        :param feature_names: Optional set of feature names
        :return: JSON serialisable numpy array, list of values, string or bytes

        Example:
            data = input["data"]
            result = self.model.predict(data)
            return result
        """
        pass

    def metrics(self):
        """
        Optional method for adding additional metrics
        :return:

        Example:
            return an array of metrics tuples
            metrics =  [{"type": "COUNTER", "key": "metric_1", "value": 1}]
            return metrics
        """
        pass

    def metadata(self):
        """
        Optional metadata method.
        :return:

        Example:
            meta = {"field": "value"}
            return meta
        """
        pass
```
